                components. The rotors are designed to create excessive shear
                forces that wreck down aggregates and lightly distribute fillers
                like carbon black, oils, and other additives. The end result is
                a homogeneous mixture, that’s important for achieving most
                reliable overall performance in completed rubber merchandise.
                The green operation of the kneader guarantees that the rubber
